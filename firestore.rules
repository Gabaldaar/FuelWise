/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for MotorLog application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows any authenticated user to read and write most data,
 * supporting multi-user collaboration on vehicles.
 * 
 * Server-Side Cron Job:
 * A special rule is in place to allow our server-side cron job (which runs with
 * admin privileges and thus has a null `request.auth`) to read data. This is
 * necessary for the job to check all reminders across all vehicles.
