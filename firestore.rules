/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for FuelWise application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user has full control over their own data,
 * and no user can access another user's data. This is enforced through path-based authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. The `userId` must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/vehicles/{vehicleId}: Stores vehicles owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/vehicles/{vehicleId}/fuel_records/{fuelRecordId}: Stores fuel records for a specific vehicle.
 * - /users/{userId}/vehicles/{vehicleId}/service_reminders/{serviceReminderId}: Stores service reminders for a specific vehicle.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Data is nested under /users/{userId} to enforce ownership.
 * - No user listing is allowed to protect privacy.
 * - The rules rely on path-based authorization, checking the `request.auth.uid` against the `userId` parameter in the path.
